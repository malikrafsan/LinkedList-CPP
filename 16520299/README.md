## About The Program
- This program was developed to complete the Dagozilla ITB Day 2 Internship assignment. This program is about linked list manipulation using the C++ programming language. This program uses the command line interface to request input commands from the user. The commands that can be performed are varied, ranging from adding and deleting nodes in the linked list, in front, behind, in a certain position, adding and deleting multiple nodes at once; reverse the order of the linked list; search for the maximum-minimum value; and many more

## How To Run
- Clone this repository
- Change directory to this repository folder and to 16520299 folder
- Open shell (bash) terminal and use this command
```sh
g++ main.cpp subprogram.cpp -o main
./main
```
- Enjoy the program! :D

## Command That Can be Performed
1. Print linked list
2. Add node to the linked list
    - Add only 1 node
        * Add a node in front of linked list
        * Add a node behind the linked list
        * Add a node in certain position of linked list
    - Add multiple nodes
        * Add multiple nodes in front of linked list
        * Add multiple nodes behind the linked list
3. Delete node from the linked list
    - Delete first node that has certain value
    - Delete node in certain position
    - Delete first node
    - Delete last node
    - Delete all nodes
    - Delete all duplicate nodes
4. Inverse / reverse linked list
5. Check linked list
    - Check whether linked list is empty
    - Check whether certain value is in the linked list and what its address and position
    - Check maximum value in linked list
    - Check minimum value in linked list
    - Check length of linked list 
6.  Copy and concat linked list (doubling the size)
7.  Sorting linked list
0.  Exit program
