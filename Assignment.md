3. Create a folder with your NIM as the folder name and implement your changes in the folder.
4. Create a README inside the folder to explain your work and how to run it.
5. Only push your source code and markdown file. (use [gitignore](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-what-is-it-and-how-to-add-to-repo/))
